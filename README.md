# Calculator :heavy_multiplication_x: :heavy_division_sign: :heavy_plus_sign: :heavy_minus_sign:

Built a calculator. This application demonstrates my ability to use JavaScript to render HTML in the DOM, use event listeners to handle user input, and write functions to handle calculations. Styling uses flexbox for the layout and psuedo classes for special highlighting effects on clear, equals, and operator buttons.

This project is hosted on GitHub pages [here](https://cdhorn515.github.io/week_3-calculator/).
